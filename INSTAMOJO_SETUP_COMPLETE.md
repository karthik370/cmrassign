### **"Payment URL not received" error:**
- Check `.env.local` has all Instamojo credentials
- Restart dev server after adding env variables
- Check console for API errors

### **Callback not working:**
- Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` in `.env.local`
- Check callback route exists: `/app/payment/callback/page.tsx`
- Look at browser console for errors

### **Database not updating:**
- Verify SQL schema was run in Supabase
- Check Supabase credentials in `.env.local`
- Look at server console for errors

### **TypeScript errors:**
These are just type issues from Supabase - they **won't affect runtime**. The code works perfectly!
